# go-github-actions

- I have created this repository to study and understand the basic concepts of CI/CD processes. 
- I have used GO programming language in my main project, I have also added a test file into my project which contains test functions for each function in main.go file.
- Then I studied and tried different cases to be able to understood how Workplaces, Jobs, Steps work.
- The changes can be seen via commits.
